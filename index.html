		<div>Once you’ve figured out the steps and how to dance the dance, you can show it off a bit. You might call in a preview audience and get a bit of interest happening before you debut your dance at the big show. By now you’re sure you can do ‘The Lift’ and think this will be pretty impressive and inspire people to come along to the big event.

Figure out what your conference’s ‘Lift’ move is and promote it. Get people intrigued and interested. You want to make sure you’re attracting the right people too. No point showing off your moves to people who won’t get anything out of the big event. So you need to ask: ‘Who’s going to get the most out of what I’ve got to offer?’ And when you’ve found an answer, they’re the ones you target in your promotional strategy.</div>
		<div>CHAPTER PROGRESS •••••••••••••••</div>

</div>
		<div>Chapter #2 | Showing Off: Promoting your conference
</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>CHAPTER PROGRESS •••••••••••••••</div>
		<div>By the end of this chapter you will be able to:
Establish a promotional strategy for your conference to attract target participants
Prepare publicity material in relation to your strategy, budget and timelines</div>
		<div>CHAPTER PROGRESS •••••••••••••••</div>
		<div>Your promotion strategy is about attracting participants.
You want to plan and put it together well in advance to give
yourself enough time to roll it out properly – making sure all the elements are in place. You want to make sure that when you promote your conference, you’re looking at reasons why the participants would want to come along – and why they wouldn’t. It’s not about spruiking free stuff or how many vendors you’re showcasing (although this can be part of it). It’s really about working out what you’re offering and why it would be worthwhile for others. Create a relationship with your participants before they even step foot inside the conference venue. If people can see you’re interested in them, they’re more likely to respond positively.

So, how do you build an effective promotion strategy
for your conference?</div>
		<div>CHAPTER PROGRESS •••••••••••••••</div>
		<div>Relevant industry groups. You want to make sure the right people are showing up to hear what you’ve got to say. Market research is important so you know how to promote your conference in a language your target audience will understand.
Benefits for attendees. Sometimes it’s stressful for people to take time off work to attend a conference, especially if they’re trying to meet deadlines or in the middle of a big project. You need to be able to articulate the benefits so that people can see that it’s worth it (in other words what participants will get out it). Maybe they’ll learn a new skill to better manage their workload!
Speakers and the information presented. What are the key takeaways participants can expect from the conference? Can you offer a ‘taster’ so they can make up their mind about whether they want to commit to the whole package?</div>
		<div>Consider that you’re talking to people, to individuals, when you’re promoting. If you just think numbers, you’re already disengaging from the message you need to be communicating to each participant.

So, when putting together your promotion strategy, consider the following:Numbers. Some people might like the idea of a small conference as they can network and build relationships. Others might be attracted to bigger events to promote their products and services. Sometimes knowing numbers needs to be part of how you sell your conference.
Date, time and location of the conference. What other things are going on at the same time or what does the area have to offer potential participants? Maybe there’s a food festival on that weekend too or they can visit the city’s famous night market.</div>
		<div>CHAPTER PROGRESS •••••••••••••••</div>
		<div>CHAPTER PROGRESS •••••••••••••••</div>
		<div>Once you’ve got your strategy nailed, you can move on to design and production of publicity materials. Through publicity, you will be looking to reach your target market and draw in potential participants. Your publicity campaign might be primarily online or a combination of online and offline initiatives. It will depend on the purpose of your conference and the target market (and of course the budget).

Check out this collection of handy hints to help form your promotion strategy.</div>
		<div>CHAPTER PROGRESS •••••••••••••••</div>
		<div>Well, you’re all over the planning, now what about the promotion? It’s no good having an event if no-one knows anything about it. Unlike birthday parties, there’s a bit more to promoting a conference than just sending out some Barbie or Transformers themed invites. There’s a lot to do and so many options available for promotion – the question is, what do you choose and what resources do you have to make it work? Does the budget support sending a blimp across the city with your conference name on it? Probably not. Effective publicity can be a costly exercise and if you’re on budget, you might just have to pull back a little before locking in the blimp guy.

Luckily, we’ve got some other cost-effective ideas.</div>
		<div>CHAPTER PROGRESS •••••••••••••••</div>
		<div>Creating a brand will help to unify all your promotional materials. Where possible, use your brand to highlight your conference theme and purpose. Figuring out images, fonts, colours, language and tone, and using these consistently, helps to create a snapshot of the type of conference you’re putting on. A Graphic Designer can help to set you up with everything you need and then you can carry this brand through in the following; website, email templates, invitations, advertising, social media posts and conference programs.

Here’s an interesting take on branding. These guys branded their conference in a way that showed the sense of humour and easy going attitude of the company’s people and culture. And it worked – profits skyrocketed...</div>
		<div>Maui Beverages
In an effort to let people know how fun and unique they were, Maui Beverages developed a unique publicity stunt. They announced that all executives would now have new titles that were more lighthearted and casual. The CEO became the Chief Entertainment Officer and the CTO became the Chief Tasting Officer. The founders, Mark Mahoney and Al Williams, hosted an annual conference for food and beverage writers, throwing a Jimmy Buffett-type "Caribbean island" theme. They handed out free sunglasses and samples of the products, encouraging the writers to include a mention of them in their articles. One year after the stunt, sales had risen to $10 million.

An option (for the really, really, really tight budget) includes using a program like Canva to create good-quality promo materials. Check it out here...</div>
		<div>Doing some market research can help you to figure out what channels your target market are most likely to use. No point putting something on social media if it’s not going to reach your desired audience. Options could include; Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or Tumblr – or a combination. Often cross-promotion across a number of channels can be effective – using a consistent branding message is important though so that a ‘personality’ develops for the conference. Encouraging your personal and professional network to share posts is also another way to spread your message further.</div>
		<div>Get your mailing list right before reeling off the invitations. It’s especially important if you have a ‘priority’ list of people that need to be included in the first round of invitations such as sponsors, suppliers or brand ambassadors. You will need to send these invitations relatively early so that you can see how the numbers are tracking, and then send out further invitations if required. If you’re selling tickets, using Electronic Direct Marketing can be effective. Reminders and ‘last chance’ opportunities also help to get people in the door, as there will always be those who can’t make up their mind and won’t commit until they’re absolutely sure.</div>
		<div>While you don’t want to get too gimmicky, as this could put people off (and won’t be appropriate for some conferences), you could offer some incentives to get people to commit early. ‘Early bird’ discounts on conference costs or offering prizes for early sign up are some examples. You could also shop around and package up deals with accommodation, restaurants and/or activities relevant to your target market. If you’re near a river, it could be a ferry cruise or if you’re near an art gallery, entry to an exhibition. Do all the hard work for your target market and make it sound like a holiday – to help draw them in. And if the budget allows, can you get some pens, notepads or showbags organised?</div>
		<div>Putting up previews of what to expect could be an effective hook. All this could be on your website or the website could link to preview material. Creating a YouTube channel means you put promo stuff up as well as videos of your speakers in action or previews of activities participants will be engaging in. You can then reference this link in other social media advertising. Other options include sending out invites to a webinar which will preview the material and/or speakers to be seen at the conference. Podcasts are also becoming increasingly popular, as people can plug in on the train or on the go to hear a bit of what the conference will offer.</div>
		<div>Get on forums, contribute to blogs and post or write something meaningful. Don’t just bang on about the conference from the word go. Find relevant forums and blogs and actually start to build a relationship with the people engaging with them. Once you’re a part of that circle (if you weren’t already before the conference), you could drop a link here and there and talk about presenters/speakers at your conference, to entice people to take a look at your website.</div>
		<div>While now considered an old tool, press releases can still be effective. If it’s a small event for your community on ‘Going Organic’ for instance, getting the local newspaper on board can give you coverage and help drive participants to the event. They’re more than likely going to read the local newspaper and share information they take from the newspaper with each other. There’s also a number of online press release distribution services that could help promo campaigns for conferences and events.</div>
		<div>Reminding your target market about registering for the upcoming conference is important. People are inundated with so much information these days that it can be pretty easy to forget about an email or online post. Sending well-timed messages that are consistent in nature is important. Just be careful not to bombard people. They can get really annoyed if they feel they’re being continually harassed and this could be counter productive.</div>
		<div>Plastering an ad across a full page in a newspaper might not be a good use of your advertising budget. And does your target market read this newspaper? Think about where your target market are most likely to be reached. If you’re trying to reach particular people, you might be able to engage with them via online groups, noticeboards at certain locations or by wearing a gorilla suit and handing out flyers at the local uni. Identify likely touch points for your target audience before publishing or printing anything.</div>
		<div>Listings pages that provide info about events are a good idea to reach your target market in a different way. It will just take a bit of research and nouse to figure out which ones will best attract possible participants from your target market. You could use something like Eventbrite but may need to use this in conjunction with other publicity materials to drive traffic to it.

Eventbrite can capture the info about your conference and manage ticket sales as well. Check them out here.</div>
		<div>CHAPTER PROGRESS •••••••••••••••</div>
		<div>All in all, understanding your target market well is essential when creating an effective promotional campaign. If it’s a crazy, off-beat location and a whole lot of young professional millennials attending, then your promotion will want to hype up the unique location through channels that will reach this audience – which will more than likely be online. It’s all a matter of doing some market research, capturing the purpose and style of your conference in the branding and then sending your message through the right channels.

If your conference is internal, you won’t need as many bells and whistles. You can take advantage of your organisation’s internal messaging system, email or LMS to disseminate information. You do want to get employees interested though – so that they’re more on board should any changes be expected as a result of this professional development opportunity. Having engaged employees also means higher morale and increased camaraderie which positively affects workplace culture.</div>
		<div>CHAPTER PROGRESS •••••••••••••••</div>
		<div>While Facebook is still popular, you could also look at options like Google+, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr or Reddit which are on the rise.</div>
		<div>Change all email signatures, voicemail messages and call to action banners on the website to draw attention to the conference.</div>
		<div>CHAPTER PROGRESS •••••••••••••••</div>
		<div>Can you put up videos that show clips of your speakers, presenters or entertainers, offer insights into your organisation, identify benefits or use highlights of previous conferences? Be sure to share video on other social media channels.</div>
		<div>Make sure you’re encouraging people to share posts and information about the conference. Not all posts need to be promotional – some might have real education content, so as to highlight the value of the conference.</div>
		<div>While they might seem a little old school, according to statistics they still work. There are plenty of great software options to create and manage email campaigns. They can also keep track of the number of opens, subscribers and nonsubscribers.</div>
